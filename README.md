# Qkart
An e-commerce application using ReactJS and Material UI, providing customers with a diverse range of products to explore. The core functionalities, including authentication, shopping cart management, and the checkout process, were implemented. To fetch and display data from the backend server, I utilized REST APIs. Additionally, I ensured that user data remains persistent on the client-side by leveraging local storage. Moreover, I implemented debouncing in the search bar to optimize search functionality and enhance user experience.
